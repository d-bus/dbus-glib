dbus-gmain - GLib main loop integration for libdbus
===================================================

This directory contains GLib main loop integration for libdbus, salvaged
from dbus-glib. At the moment it is designed to be bundled in other
projects using the `git subtree` or `git submodule` commands.

Please do not use this module unless you really need it. The majority
of GLib-based D-Bus users would be better off using GDBus, part of GLib,
instead of the low-level APIs provided by libdbus. In particular, the
combination of dbus-gmain and libdbus is known to have thread-safety
issues.

However, using this module is still better than using dbus-glib; the
rest of dbus-glib mostly consists of design flaws.
